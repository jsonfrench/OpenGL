Hello! This is going to be where I publish my progress on trying to learn OpenGL, an open graphics library that requires a 
PhD in computer science to use. After three days straight of installing and painstakingly making my way through the manual 
for this godforsaken library, I have managed to create a single empty window!You can even resize it! The manual in question 
can be found at https://learnopengl.com and is written by the wonderful Joey de Vries. Also, Codeus graced me with his 
genuinely useful and to the point video on youtube "C++ OpenGL setup for VSCode in 2min" which can be found here:
